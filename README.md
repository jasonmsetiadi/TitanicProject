## Titanic Kaggle Competition
This is my first end to end project on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) 
using the Titanic Dataset.

This project is about predicting whether a passenger survived or not.
Hence, this is a supervised binary classification problem.
There are several steps in building an end to end project. 
1. Data Preprocessing

When preprocessing the data, we can perform Feature Selection, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, as well as Feature Scaling. There are no specific orders
of performing these steps, it depends on the dataset we are working with.

2. Model Selection

In this step, I used several common models for solving a binary classification
problem. We can compute the accuracy of each model to see which models gives 
the best accuracy using cross validation.

3. Model Tuning

After getting the best performing models, we can tune them to get the best
hyperparameters for those models. This is done to improve the accuracy even further.

4. Test Set

Lastly, we can perform preprocessing on the test set as well as predict
the survival of each passenger using the tuned model.
